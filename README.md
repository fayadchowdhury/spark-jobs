# Spark-Jobs

This repository is going to house all of my experimental PySpark scripts. I may set up a CI/CD pipeline to build Docker images with required JARs later.

## Setup

Clone this repository and do poetry install.

## Structure

The experiments/ folder contains all the Jupyter notebooks, and the rest of the files are according to their standard definitions in Python Poetry projects and Github repositories.
